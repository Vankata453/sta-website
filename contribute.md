## Translation contribution

SuperTux Advance needs your help with translation! You can update or create translations in languages you know to help the game be more reachable.

[View current translations](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/supertux-advance/tree/main/lang){:target="_blank"} and [download](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4604663/download-single-files-from-github){:target="_blank"} one, if you want to update it.

### Tip!
You can use [SuperTux Advance Translator](https://vankata453.github.io/sta-translator/){:target="_blank"} to translate more conveniently. This is not required, but it can simplify the process and is always updated with the newest available lines for translation in English. You can import existing translations to update as well.

### Finishing
If you have finished creating or improving a translation, you can contribute it in two ways:

1. Choose a method to [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) with and send us the `.json` file directly.
2. [Open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request){:target="_blank"} to the [SuperTux Advance repository](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/supertux-advance){:target="_blank"} (more info above).

## Custom Worlds

We're currently experimenting with contributor worlds. At the moment, if you make a world, you can submit them over Discord or via a pull request on GitHub to the main repository. In the future, separate repositories will be used to allow players to subscribe to individual worlds.
